# Magento-2
Magento is an open-source e-commerce platform written in PHP. It uses multiple other PHP frameworks such as Laminas (formerly know as Zend Framework) and Symfony. Magento source code is distributed under Open Software License (OSL) v3.0. Magento was acquired by Adobe Inc in May 2018 for $1.68 billion.[2]  The software was originally developed by Varien Inc., a US private company headquartered in Culver City, California, with assistance from volunteers and open source software contributors.  More than 150,000 [3] online stores have been created on the platform. The platform code has been downloaded more than 2.5 million times, and $155 billion worth of goods were sold through Magento-based systems in 2019.[4] As of April 2021, Magento holds a 2.32% market share in global e-commerce platforms.[5]  Varien published the first general-availability release of the software on March 31, 2008. Roy Rubin, the former CEO of Varien, later sold a share of the company to eBay, which eventually completely acquired and then sold the company to Permira;[6] Permira later sold it to Adobe.[7]
